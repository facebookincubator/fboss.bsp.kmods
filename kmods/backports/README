Back-ported BSP Drivers
=======================

We need to backport upstreamed drivers to the BSP package when:
  - the drivers are not included in the FBOSS kernel but available in
    newer kernel releases.
  - the drivers are included in the FBOSS kernel but the kconfig option
    is not enabled.

All the drivers (and "pmbus.h") are backported from fbkernel 6.11.1-fbk3,
except "lm25066.c" which is backported from fbkernel 6.4.3-fbk16, because
lm25066.c from Linux 6.11 cannot be compiled in Linux 6.4.

All the backported drivers (except ledtrig-timer.c) are prefixed with
"bp4f_" (stands for Backporting for FBOSS) to avoid conflicts with the
upstreamed version of drivers.
